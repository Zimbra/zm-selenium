that she spotted in a <a href=3D"http://www.baltimoresun.com/business/money=
/bs-bz-ambrose-401k-fees-20101018,0,5833793.story">comment on a story in th=
e Baltimore Sun</a>:</p>
<p style=3D"padding-left: 30px;"><span style=3D"color: #000080;">401K fund =
managers have been ripping off employees blind for the past 30 years. the e=
mployers have known this and have hidden this from the employees. the SEC h=
as known this, but really doesn't care or <strong>have the wear-with-all</s=
trong> to go after every single 401K management firm because many of them a=
re divisions within large financial firms that lobby congress every year to=
 keep a lid on it.</span> <em>[emphasis added]</em></p>
<p><span id=3D"more-2721"></span>This one was <a href=3D"http://eggcorns.la=
scribe.net/forum/viewtopic.php?id=3D1186">discussed at length</a> in the Eg=
gcorn Forum on 10/20/2006 by jorkel. It's a classic eggcorn, in the sense t=
hat it provides a (somewhat) interpretable re-analysis for a compound (here=
 <em>where</em> + <em>withal</em>) that no longer makes much if any sense i=
n its conventional meaning, The re-analysis remains a bit opaque, but as jo=
rkel puts it</p>
<p style=3D"padding-left: 30px;"><span style=3D"color: #800000;">As an eggc=
orn, =E2=80=9Cwear-with-all=E2=80=9D could possibly refer to versatile clot=
hing: useable for all purposes. This interpretation captures the notion of =
a resource. But, since I can=E2=80=99t read the utterers=E2=80=99 mind, an =
alternative interpretation of =E2=80=9Cwear-with-all=E2=80=9D is the abilit=
y to weather whatever comes =E2=80=A6perhaps even have the fortitude to end=
ure the wear.</span></p>
<p>Barbara's suggestion:</p>
<p style=3D"padding-left: 30px;"><span style=3D"color: #000080;">This is pr=
obably not the first time that people have thought having an adequate wardr=
obe denotes having adequate funds.</span></p>
