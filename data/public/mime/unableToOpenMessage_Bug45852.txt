Hello All, 

Is there anything else you need from me? University of Guelph is running into the same issue.

Thanks for the data.  It sounds like a JSP client issue.  Can someone from client team help?  The appointment shows on the correct date in month view but not in week/workweek/day views.

Thank you Jiho. Ics file attached. The PC's timezone is US/Eastern. Time
zone for account preferences is set to US/Eastern as well.

Should be able to repro with their test account.

Just now I set my PC Timezone for US/Eastern, created an appt for March
30 @ 1:00pm, but when I view the public calendar, the appt shows March
29 @ 1:00pm.

Rick, can you find out a few things for me?

- ics dump of the appointment
- what time zone the PC running the ajax client is in
- time zone set in the account's preference

Thank you Jiho. In the screen shots below, the correct date is March 29.
In the example, the appt was created from the ajax-client, and it is
displayed correctly from the ajax-client; just not from the public
calendar.

What date is the appointment supposed to be on? March 28/29 is right
around the daylight savings transition, and my guess is ajax client is
showing the wrong date.

Hello Calendar-Team,

Do you have any theories why a public calendar would display
appointments a day behind ajax/standard clients? ie, Appt created March
29 @ 5:00pm from ajax, would be displayed March 28 @ 5:00pm from a
public calendar.
