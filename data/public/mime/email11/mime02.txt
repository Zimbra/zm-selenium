The Boeing 767 is a mid-size, wide-body twin-engine jet airliner built by B=
oeing Commercial Airplanes. It was the manufacturer's first wide-body twinj=
et and its first airliner with a two-crew glass cockpit. The aircraft has t=
wo turbofan engines, a conventional tail, and, for reduced aerodynamic drag=
, a supercritical wing design. Designed as a smaller wide-body airliner tha=
n preceding aircraft such as the 747, the 767 has a capacity of 181 to 375 =
persons and a design range of 3,850 to 6,385 nautical miles (7,130 to 11,82=
5 km), depending on variant. Development of the 767 occurred in tandem with=
 a narrow-body twinjet, the 757, resulting in shared design features which =
allow pilots to obtain a common type rating to operate both aircraft.
