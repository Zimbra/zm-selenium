In 1970, Boeing's 747 became the first wide-body jetliner to enter service.=
[3] The 747 was the first passenger jet that was wide enough to feature a t=
win-aisle cabin.[4] Two years later, the manufacturer began a development s=
tudy, code-named 7X7, for a new wide-body aircraft intended to replace the =
707 and other early generation narrow-body jets.[5][6] The aircraft would a=
lso provide twin-aisle seating, but in a smaller fuselage than the existing=
 747, McDonnell Douglas DC-10, and Lockheed L-1011 TriStar wide-bodies.[5] =
To defray the high cost of development, Boeing signed risk-sharing agreemen=
ts with Italian corporation Aeritalia and the Civil Transport Development C=
orporation (CTDC), a consortium of Japanese aerospace companies.[7] This ma=
rked the manufacturer's first major international joint venture, and both A=
eritalia and the CTDC received supply contracts in return for their early p=
articipation.[7] The initial 7X7 was conceived as a short take-off and land=
ing airliner intended for short-distance flights, but customers were unenth=
usiastic about the concept, leading to its redefinition as a mid-size, tran=
scontinental-range airliner.[5] At this stage the proposed aircraft feature=
d two or three engines, with possible configurations including over-wing en=
gines and a T-tail.[3]

As of April 2013, Boeing has received 1,108 orders for the 767 from 71 cust=
omers; 1,045 have been delivered. A total of 838 of these aircraft were in =
service in July 2012; the most popular variant is the 767-300ER, with 552 d=
elivered; Delta Air Lines is the largest operator, with 94 aircraft. Compet=
itors have included the Airbus A300, A310, and A330-200, while a successor,=
 the 787 Dreamliner, entered service in October 2011.

United Airlines first placed the 767 in commercial service in 1982. The air=
craft was initially flown on domestic and transcontinental routes, during w=
hich it demonstrated the reliability of its twinjet design. In 1985, the 76=
7 became the first twin-engined airliner to receive regulatory approval for=
 extended overseas flights. The aircraft was then used to expand non-stop s=
ervice on medium- to long-haul intercontinental routes. In 1986, Boeing ini=
tiated studies for a higher-capacity 767, ultimately leading to the develop=
ment of the 777, a larger wide-body twinjet. In the 1990s, the 767 became t=
he most frequently used airliner for transatlantic flights between North Am=
erica and Europe.

The 767 is produced in three fuselage lengths. The original 767-200 entered=
 service in 1982, followed by the 767-300 in 1986 and the 767-400ER, an ext=
ended-range (ER) variant, in 2000. The extended-range 767-200ER and 767-300=
ER models entered service in 1984 and 1988, respectively, while a productio=
n freighter version, the 767-300F, debuted in 1995. Conversion programs hav=
e modified passenger 767-200 and 767-300 series aircraft for cargo use, whi=
le military derivatives include the E-767 surveillance aircraft, the KC-767=
 and KC-46 aerial tankers, and VIP transports. Engines featured on the 767 =
include the General Electric CF6, Pratt & Whitney JT9D and PW4000, and Roll=
s-Royce RB211 turbofans.

The Boeing 767 is a mid-size, wide-body twin-engine jet airliner built by B=
oeing Commercial Airplanes. It was the manufacturer's first wide-body twinj=
et and its first airliner with a two-crew glass cockpit. The aircraft has t=
wo turbofan engines, a conventional tail, and, for reduced aerodynamic drag=
, a supercritical wing design. Designed as a smaller wide-body airliner tha=
n preceding aircraft such as the 747, the 767 has a capacity of 181 to 375 =
persons and a design range of 3,850 to 6,385 nautical miles (7,130 to 11,82=
5 km), depending on variant. Development of the 767 occurred in tandem with=
 a narrow-body twinjet, the 757, resulting in shared design features which =
allow pilots to obtain a common type rating to operate both aircraft.
